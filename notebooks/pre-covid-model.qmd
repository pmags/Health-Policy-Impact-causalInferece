## Plan:

Use box-jenkins approach

1.  Explore visualy estacionarity and seasonality
2.  explore differencing and box-cox transform
3.  model p and q
4.  Define test and train parts for cross validation
5.  use mse and aic for selecting models

Apply both this approach to barcelos and vila do conde.
